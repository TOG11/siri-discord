# Geting Started

First off you need to make a Twilio Account, to do so make one [HERE](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) (Dont worry about the free trial!)

On the Left-hand side of the Twilio console click  Phone Numbers > Manage > Active Numbers 
Here you will create your phone number that Siri will text. It doesnt matter what number you pick.

Once you've got a phone number from Twilio download the following (if not already downloaded)

[NGROK](https://ngrok.com/)

[VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[NODE.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once these are installed create a new directory on your computer.
inside that directory create a index.js file.</P>
in the project directory bar type "cmd", this will open a terminal.

in that terminal type "**npm init -y**", after that is done type in "**npm i discord.js**", "**npm i body-parser**", "**npm i express**"

then open the index.js in Vscode, and paste the code from code.js into it.
